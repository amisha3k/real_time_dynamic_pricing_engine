# 🛒 Dynamic Pricing Engine with Business Insights

This project implements a **machine learning-based dynamic pricing engine** that predicts the optimal product price using **LightGBM** and **XGBoost** models.  
It not only focuses on model accuracy but also evaluates **business-centric metrics** such as **Revenue** and **Profit**, helping businesses maximize profitability while maintaining competitive pricing.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Price Prediction** using LightGBM and XGBoost
- **Business Insights Dashboard** (Streamlit):
  - Predicted Price per model
  - Estimated Revenue and Profit
  - Model performance comparison (MAE, R²)
  - Visual Profit Analysis
- **Feature Engineering**: moving averages, elasticity, demand trend factors
- **REST API** powered by FastAPI for real-time predictions
- **Streamlit UI** for business users and non-technical stakeholders

## 📊 Model Performance
- **LightGBM**
  - Validation L2 Loss: ~97
  - MAE: ~12.5  
  - R² Score: ~0.87

- **XGBoost**
  - Validation MAE: ~8.1  
  - MAE: ~13.2  
  - R² Score: ~0.85  

## 💹 Business Value
- Provides **optimal pricing recommendations** to maximize profit.
- Estimates **revenue and profit impact** of predicted prices.
- Helps businesses **adapt to competitor pricing, stock levels, and demand trends**.
- Reduces manual effort in pricing strategy through **AI-driven automation**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **LightGBM**, **XGBoost**
- **FastAPI** (API service)
- **Streamlit** (Dashboard UI)
- **Joblib** (Model serialization)

## 🎯 Example Prediction
```json
{
  "lightgbm_price": 58.39,
  "xgboost_price": 67.35,
  "estimate_revenue": 7007.50,
  "estimated_profit": 4607.50
}
```
