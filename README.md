# ðŸ›’ Dynamic Pricing Engine (ML-Based)

Dynamic Pricing Engine is a Machine Learning-powered project designed to predict optimal product prices based on demand, seasonality, and product features.
It integrates a Streamlit frontend with a FastAPI backend and leverages ML models for real-time price recommendations.

## Features

- ML-Based Price Prediction: Predicts optimal product prices using trained machine learning models.
- Streamlit Frontend: Interactive dashboard for visualizing and experimenting with pricing strategies.
- FastAPI Backend: Serves API endpoints for real-time predictions.
- Data Handling: Supports product input via API or UI.
- Visualization: Compare actual vs. predicted prices through charts and tables.
- Modular Design: Easy to extend with new models or features.
